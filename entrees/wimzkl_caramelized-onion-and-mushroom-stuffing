# WIMZKL's Caramelized Onion and Mushroom Stuffin'

Simple, hot, and tasty stuff to share with pals.

## Cooking Hardware

- 1 or 2 15" x 10" x 2" rectangular baking dish
- 2 rimmed baking sheets (but only if you choose to make croutons)
- 1 large non-stick skillet
- 1 small saucepan
- 1 large mixing bowl
- Cooking utensils for stirring
- A Sharp chef's knife for cutting and chopping stuff
- Cutting board (make sure to put a damp cloth underneath so it doesn't slide around - be safe!)
- Standard stove/oven

## Ingredients

- 6 Tablespoons salted butter, plus a little more to rub/coat this inside of the Pyrex or glass bakeware with.
- 1 large loaf of bread (I like to use somewhat old homemade sourdough and make croutons) but you can use any of your favorite bread or store-bought croutons (about 1 pound). *If you use your favorite bread to make homemade croutons, it works well to cut it into 3⁄4-inch pieces (about 16 cups) because they will shrink when you bake them. Sturdy breads like pumpernickel and Sourdough seem to work best for this recipe.
- 6 medium onions, halved, medium sliced, and chopped
- 1 bunch of celery, chopped medium-thick, not too thin, we want it to be a little bit crunchy so a little thicker is better.
- A pinch or 3 of sea salt and fresh ground black pepper, as you like.
-	½ cup balsamic vinegar (sometimes I use way more than this).
- 3 or so cups vegetable stock  (I like to use stock made from leftover veggies but store bought works well, too).
- 4-5 cups jumbo mushrooms - chopped into big chunks - the more the merrier.
- 1 tablespoon freshly choppsed thyme (sometimes sage is good, too).

## How to make it

Croutons - if you choose to make the croutons yourself, it's easy, delicious, and pretty satisfying to do:
- Cut your favorite bread into very large crouton-sized chunks.
- Toss them in a big mixing bowl with some olive oil, salt, and pepper, as you like (be careful not to use too much oil or they will smoke you out of the kitchen when you bake them).
- Divide them between 2 rimmed baking sheets and bake until dry, a bit golden, and crisp, 10 minutes or so.
- When they're done, set them aside.

The Stuffin'

1. Melt the 6 tablespoons of butter in the large non-stick skillet over medium heat. 
2. Add the onions, a pinch or two of salt, and pepper, as you like. 
3. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are a deep golden brown, about an hour or so. 
4. When they're nice and brown, reduce them with the balsamic and cook until it's all evaporated, which only takes a little while. 
5. While they're cooking down, you can heat your oven to 375° F.
6. When the balsamic is all reduced, transfer the onions to a large bowl and let cool for for a few minutes.
7. Butter up the 15x10x2-inch baking dish (or 2 depending on how many are coming over) and make sure the inside is completely and more or less evenly coated.
8. In a large mixing bowl, combine your croutons, stock, shrooms, thyme/sage, onions, and sprinkle ½ teaspoon of sea salt over the top. 
9. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish(es). 
10. Cover with buttered foil and bake for 30-40 minutes. 
11. Uncover and bake until golden brown on top (yummy), 20 minutes or so more.

And enjoy!
